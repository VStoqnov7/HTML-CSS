                    Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s web (and
                    which you may have seen appear on parts of your web browser):
                    HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The markup (formatting) language for the web.
                    URI: Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address” that is unique and used to identify to each
                    resource on the web. It is also commonly called a URL.
                    HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the web.
